# PRODIGY_ML_01
Task 1 of Machine learning internship at Prodigy Infotech 

We have created a Machine Learning Regression Model using sklearn and linear regression on banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.
During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and Google Colab as IDE
